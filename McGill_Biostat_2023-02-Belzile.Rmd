# Exponential growth of mortality

.small[

> *It is believed that exponential growth of mortality with age (Gompertz law) is followed by a period of deceleration, with slower rates of mortality increase at older ages.*

> *Recent studies found that the exponential increase of the mortality risk with age (the famous Gompertz law) continues even at extreme old ages in humans, rats, and mice, thus challenging traditional views about old-age mortality deceleration, mortality leveling-off, and late-life mortality plateaus.*

The Gompertz–Makeham model is extremely popular in demography and fits well the distribution of lifetimes at lower levels, until 102-105.

- rate of 5.1 per 10K in 2015

In Canada, Census 2021 indentified 9 545 centenarians (6116 female, 1830 male)
- rate of 1.9 per 10K in 2016

Between 1983 and 2009, a total of 
- 12 supercentenarians died
- 321 semisupercentenarians died
in Quebec.

- oldest living today: Maria Branyas Morera (115 years, 148 days)

Shigechio Izumi was excluded from records because he beared his dead brother name, so died age 105 rather than 120.

In Japan, the first modern family registration system was established in 1872 (Jinshin-KOSEKI), amended in 1886 by the Family Registration Law, Chapter 10 of Exceptional Lifespan.

Italy: example of teenager reportedly borned in 1800s, who died age 13 but was initially recorded to have died 113.

- for IDL, (only) supercentenarians in a country .color-2[**who died**] between dates $c_1$ and $c_2$.

Ignoring truncation leads to  .section-title-2[**underestimation**] of the survival probability: population increase and reduction in mortality at lower age translates into larger impact for later birth cohorts.

- $F_0$ is the postulated (i.e., fitted) parametric distribution,

# Survival analysis

Denote the lifetime $T$, a continuous random variable with distribution $F$, density $f$, lifespan $t_{F}= \sup\{t: F(t) < 1\}$ and survivor and hazard functions

$$\begin{align*}
 S(t) &= \Pr(T>t) =1-F(t), 
\\h(t) &= \frac{f(t)}{S(t)}, \quad t>0.
\end{align*}$$

---

# Poisson process

- Suppose individuals independently reach age $u_0$ at calendar time $x$ at rate $\nu(x)$, and subsequently die at age $t+u_0$ with density $f$.
- Events in $\mathcal{C} = [c_1 , c_2] \times [u_0, \infty)$ follow a Poisson process of rate
$$\begin{align*}
\lambda(c, t) = \nu(c − t)f(t), \qquad
c \in \mathbb{R}, t > 0
\end{align*}$$
at calendar time $c$ and excess lifetime $t$.

---

# Poisson process

- The lifetime density for dying in $\mathcal{C}$ is
$$\begin{align*}
f_{\mathcal{C}}(t) \propto f(t)w_{\mathcal{C}}(t), \quad w_{\mathcal{C}}(t) = \int_{c_1 - t}^{c_2-t} \nu(x) \mathrm{d}x, \quad t>0
\end{align*}$$
where $w_{\mathcal{C}}$ is decreasing, so $f_{\mathcal{C}}$ is .color-3[**stochastically smaller**] than $f$.



---

# Likelihood contributions

The likelihood depends on $\nu$, hence consider the conditional likelihood
$$\begin{align*}
\frac{f(t)}{F(b)-F(a)}, \quad a < t< b
\end{align*}$$
for interval truncated data and, for left-truncated and right-censored data,
$$\begin{align*}
\frac{h(t)^\delta S(t)}{1-F(a)}, \quad t> a,
\end{align*}$$
where $[a, b] = [\max\{0, c_1 − x\}, c_2 − x]$.

---

# Popular parametric models

Hazard of models frequently used in demography:

- exponential: $h(t) = \sigma^{-1}$ for $\sigma>0$.
- Gompertz–Makeham (1825, 1860): $$h(t) = \lambda + \sigma^{-1}\exp(\beta t/\sigma), \qquad \beta, \sigma>0, \lambda \geq 0.$$
- Logistic–Makeham (Perks, 1932): 
$$h(t) = \lambda + \frac{\alpha\exp(\beta t/ \sigma)}{1+\alpha\gamma\exp(\beta t/ \sigma)}, \qquad \alpha>0, \beta\gamma \ge 0.$$


---

# Comparing models

Authors frequently fail to account for non-standard asymptotics for tests.

- The Gompertz model includes the exponential when $\beta \to 0$ (boundary parameter) so likelihood ratio test has $\frac{1}{2}\chi^2_0 + \frac{1}{2}\chi^2_1$ null distribution.
- The Gompertz-Makeham distribution include the exponential distribution as special case, but the parameters are not numerically identifiable when $\beta \to 0$.


---

# Extreme value theory




Most records include only lifetime above $u_0$ (.color-3[**threshold exceedances**])


The .color-3[**unique nondegenerate**] limiting distribution for exceedances of a threshold $u$ is .section-title-3.inv[**generalized Pareto**].

.tiny[*Some conditions apply]

---

# Generalized Pareto distribution

If a scaling function $a_u$ exists such
that $(X − u)/a_u$ has a non-degenerate distribution conditional on $X > u$, then (Pickands, 1975)
$$\lim_{u \to t_F}\frac{\Pr\{(X-u)/a_u > t\}}{\Pr(X >u)} \to 
\begin{cases}
(1+\xi t/\sigma)_{+}^{-1/\xi}, & \xi \neq 0\\
\exp(-t/\sigma), & \xi = 0.
\end{cases}$$
where $c_+ = \max\{c, 0\}$.

---

# Penultimate approximation


At lower levels, the behaviour of the fitted model depends on the reciprocal hazard, $r(t) = 1/h(t)$; under mild regularity conditions,

$$\xi = \lim_{t \to t_{F}} r'(t)$$
and a pre-asymptotic shape is $\xi_u = r'(u)$.

--


- the Gompertz model has $\xi_u \nearrow 0$: estimates of $\xi$ tend to be negative.

???

The speed of convergence is quite fast, so we would expect the exceedances to be well approximated by an exponential distribution.

---

# Threshold stability

A key property of the generalized Pareto distribution is **threshold stability**.

- can extrapolate behaviour of $F$ at higher levels
- useful for choosing $u$ in applications
   - fit model at multiple threshold $u_1 < \cdots < u_k$.
   - check whether shape $\xi$ agrees over range.

---

# Flexibility is key

We fit a semiparametric hazard function $$h(t) = \{\sigma + \xi t + g(t)\}^{-1}_{+}$$ with $g(t) \to 0$ as $t \to t_{F}$ with $g(t)$ a cubic regression spline
- generalizes generalized Pareto model
- reduces to parametric model in upper tail
- equispaced knots

???

Left: figure obtained with bshazard for left-truncated right-censored data
Right: discretize data into daily bins, use cumulative hazard H(t) = sum_{z=1}^t h(z)/365 for interpretability, so survival function is exp(-H(x))

# Is there a finite lifespan?

Mathematically speaking, is $t_F=\sup\{t: F(t)<1\} = \infty$?


Hard to convey to the average reader:
- $t_F=\infty$ does not imply immortality.
- $\Pr(T > u) < \varepsilon$ does not imply finite lifespan $t_F < u$.



--

.box-inv-4[the answer may be in the model.]


- Gompertz–Makeham has no right endpoint  and $t_F =\infty$.
- exponential model has a constant hazard (.color-4[**plateau of mortality**]).
- the generalized Pareto implies a lifespan of $u-\sigma/\xi$ if $\xi < 0$.

---

# Is the lifetime distribution bounded?


```{r profile_lifetime, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Profile likelihood for endpoint for various countries and three thresholds.", out.width ='55%'}
magick::image_read_pdf("figures/profile_endpt.pdf", page = 1)
```

---

# Human lifespan

No discernible differences between

- earlier and later birth cohorts,
- countries,
- men and women, except that after age 108 French men have lower survival.

Not to be confused with gender inbalance due to lower survival of men.
---

# You have no power in here!

The power of a likelihood ratio test for detecting a finite endpoint (obtained by simulating records with a generalized Pareto distribution with lifespan $t_F$) is high: based on France/Italy/IDL data (2016 version),

- 125 years: combined power of 97%;
- 130 years: combined power of 83%;
- 135 years: combined power of 66%.

Suggests that the human lifespan lies well beyond any lifetime yet observed.

# Huge uncertainty

---

# Supercentenarians [don't] live forever...

Estimated exponential distribution above 110 years for IDL has mean 0.5 (0.46, 0.53): a coin toss.

--

Surviving until 130 years conditional on surviving until 110 years
- is equivalent to obtaining 20 heads in a row,
- a less than one-in-a-million chance...

--

Anticipated increase in number of supercentenarians make it possible to observe 130, but higher record is highly unlikely (Pearce & Raftery 2021).
